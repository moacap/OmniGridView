This is a half-finished grid view for iOS.
Cause Apple's UITableView only allows us to add and reuse vertical cells, we need to write our own
scroll view when we want to have horizontal cells.

HOW TO USE

Drag the OmniGridView Folder to your project. Use the OmniGridView like any other UIView.
Assign a delegate to OmniGridView and implement the OmniGridViewDelegate.

Please refer to the OmniGridTestViewController.m to see the information you need to provide.


Please use it freely, no limitation on distribution or modification.
